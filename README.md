### Statement on comparism between AWS DynamoDB and Azure Cosmos DB
After comparing pricing and features on AWS and Azure, we found that Azure Cosmos DB generally has lower pricing for provisioned throughput than AWS DynamoDB. However, we chose DynamoDB due to its pay-as-you-go pricing model, making it more suitable for highly scalable applications. DynamoDB also has features like Automated Storage Scaling and Provisioned Throughput, allowing dedicated resources to meet performance requirements. Additionally, DynamoDB has a fully distributed, shared-nothing architecture for seamless scaling of a single table over hundreds of servers. It offers a free tier with 25 GB of data storage, 2.5 million streams read requests, and 100 GB of data transfer outs, making it a more cost-effective option for smaller applications. Both AWS and Azure have similar regional availability, not a significant factor in our decision-making process.
